# API Documentation
This application has a built in REST API that accepts PTDL triggers sent in the body of a POST request. See [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19380446/2s93z3fkm1) for examples and documentation.

The API functionality is secondary to the main purpose of the application, which is to provide a server to listen for and process PTDL from ProPresenter. The API is provided as a convenience for users who wish to integrate the PTDL with other applications or to expand the functionality of the ProPresenter Triggers.

Use cases include:
- Triggering an action from a web page
- Triggering actions from a Stream Deck

The general idea is that automation tools shouldn't be single use, and should instead flexible enough to be used in a variety of ways.

More functionality is planned for the API/web server, but for now it is limited to receiving PTDL triggers.
