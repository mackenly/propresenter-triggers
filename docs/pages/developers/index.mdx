# Build Custom Actions

Actions provide the key functionality for the ProPresenter Triggers application. Within the `./actions/` directory of the app you'll find the files that define the classes used to create the actions' functionality.

Actions at their core are just Python classes. The constructor instantiates the class as an object and sets the initial state. The `run()` method is called when the action is triggered.

## State
Actions receive state from PTDL trigger values via a parameter. This state is a string that can be a single value or a JSON object. It's up to the action to parse the state and use it as needed. Here's an example:
```python copy
import json
class Example:
    def __init__(self, value):
        # Parse json value
        self.value = json.loads(value)
```


In addition to the action's parameter, actions can also get data from the `config.json` file in the app's root directory. This is useful for storing data that is used across multiple instances of an action such as:
- An API key used to call an endpoint
- A magic value used within the action's logic
- etc...

To use a config data import the `import_config()` method from the `utils` module. This will return a dictionary of the config data. The dictionary can then be accessed like any other dictionary.

```python copy
from app.utils import import_config
```

Then call the method from your code. For example:    
```python copy
self.config = import_config().get('actions')['Example'] or ""
```

## Logging
This project uses the `logging` package to log messages to the console. The `logging` package is part of the Python standard library and is used to log messages to the console. The `logging` package has a number of built-in methods for logging messages at different levels. The levels are:
- `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
- `INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
- `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
- `ERROR`: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
- `CRITICAL`: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

As normal you can import the logging package then call the `logging` methods to log messages. For example:
```python copy
import logging
logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
logging.critical('This is a critical message')
```

## Example Action
Within the `./actions/` directory you'll find an example action called `Example.py`. This action is a good starting point for creating your own actions. It has a number of comments that explain how the action works.

Find the most up to date version [here](https://github.com/mackenly/propresenter-triggers/blob/main/app/actions/Example.py) and/or copy the code below:
```python copy filename="Example.py"
import logging
from app.utils import import_config


class Example:
    """
    Class name: Example
    Class description: Example class showing the capabilities
        of the plugin system including getting data from the
        config.json file and accepting parameters.
    """
    def __init__(self, value='Default Thingy'):
        """
        Method name: __init__
        Method description: Constructor for Example class
        @param value: value to print
        """
        # Use the value passed in as a parameter (if any) or the default value
        self.value = value
        
        # Get the config value from the config.json file or an empty string
        self.config = import_config().get('actions')['Example'] or ""

    def run(self):
        """
        Method name: run
        Method description: Runner method that prints "Hello from Example action!" plus the value and config
        """
        # Print to the console
        print('Hello from Example action!\n' + self.value + "\n" + self.config)
        
        # Log to the server console
        logging.info('Hello from Example action! ' + self.value + " " + self.config)

```

## Using Your Action
This project uses a markup language called ProPresenter 3rd Party Trigger Definition Language (PTDL) which is designed for allowing users of ProPresenter to define triggers using slide and presentation notes.

Your action's key is the name of the file/class and the value can be any string. The string will be passed to the action's constructor as a parameter.

## Submitting Actions
You're welcome to use your custom actions locally simply by placing your action's file in the `./actions/` directory and making calls using PTDL, but if you'd like to submit them to be included in the ProPresenter Triggers app for other users to use, please submit a pull request to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mackenly/propresenter-triggers/blob/main/app/actions/Example.py).

All submissions will be reviewed and if relevant and appropriate will be included in the app.

Any code submitted to the repo will be licensed under the [project's license](https://github.com/mackenly/propresenter-triggers/blob/main/LICENSE), so make sure you have permission to submit the code before doing so.
