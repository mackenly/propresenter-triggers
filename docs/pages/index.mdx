# ProPresenter Triggers
Trigger actions using ProPresenter notes

## About
ProPresenter Triggers is Python console application that listens for triggers in ProPresenter notes and sends commands to other broadcast tools and equipment. Using the PTDL spec, you can define triggers in ProPresenter notes that will be sent to the application. When slides are changed in ProPresenter, the application will parse the notes and send commands to other applications and equipment as defined by the triggers.
